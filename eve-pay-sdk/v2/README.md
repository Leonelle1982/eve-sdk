# EVE Pay – V2 (Universal ESG Commerce Rail)

EVE Pay is a modular ESG commerce layer that plugs into existing ERP, OMS, and e-commerce systems without modifying core payment or revenue flows.

V2 introduces a universal integration skeleton designed to support Redmine, SAP, Odoo, NetSuite, ERPNext, and custom OMS environments.

This layer enables:
- Container return tracking
- EV delivery selection
- Per-order carbon accounting
- ESG scoring and audit-ready records

All ESG values are calculated deterministically and exported in platform-agnostic formats (JSON, CSV) for audit, reporting, and ERP ingestion

All ESG actions are logged as metadata alongside standard transactions.


EVE Pay is API-first, SDK-light, and designed for pilot, white-label, or enterprise rollout.

No revenue sharing. No lock-in. No migration.

V2 focuses on installer structure and platform adapters.

UI configurators and ESG exports are introduced in later versions.
